WABot
=====

WABot (yeah, very creative name) is a small bot that lets you play hangman or trivial solo or against friends via WhatsApp.

* You'll need a server capable of running PHP+MySQL and a WhatsApp account.
* It uses the unofficial API for WahtsApp, "WhatsAPI" https://github.com/venomous0x/WhatsAPI , for questions about how to set up please, go there, I will not answer any question about WhatsAPI
* Words for hangman and questions for trivial are in Spanish, very easy to change the files to any other language

Hangman
=======
* Add the bot to your contacts and start a chat
* Send him the command "/ahorcado" (without quotes)
* Reply with one character, replies with more than one character will not be accepted (I'm working on making it possible to discover the whole word at once)
* Each - represent a character

Trivial
=======
* Add the bot to your contacts and start a chat
* Send him the command "/trivial" (without quotes)
* Reply to the questions, each 20 seconds there will be a clue.
* After 3 clues without correct answers, the answer is given
* Each - represent a character




**DISCLAIMER:**
This bot uses the unofficial API for WhatsApp, WhatsAPI, I'm not responsible for any use you made of WhatsAPI nor the bot itself. The bot just responds to given commands, there's no way it could be used to spam other accounts.
